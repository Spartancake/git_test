  "description" : "This cross-country skiing trail is a very easy route which does not require any great effort. There are two routes leading to Dobbiaco: through the woods or across the fields. The same applies to the return route. What is especially interesting when you arrive in Dobbiaco is that you can ski as far as the Nordic Arena cross-country ski centre.",
